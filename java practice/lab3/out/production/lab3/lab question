 Introduction to Programming Lab
Lab Assignment-3


Important Note to TAs and Students: Students are encouraged to write programs for the questions given below in their lab notebooks before attending lab sessions. Both tasks, namely, writing on paper and typing on the computer are compulsory for two more weeks.

Topics covered in the recent classes: cin,cout, declaration of variables of integer data-type, while loop, for loop, break statement.

Instructions:
Save programs using the .cpp extension.

Practice Questions:
Write a program to print all natural numbers from 1 to n using the for loop.
Write a program to print all natural numbers from n to 1 using the for loop.
Write a program to print all odd numbers from 1 to n using the for loop.
Given a positive integer n, write a program to print all the digits of n individually.
Given a positive integer n, write a program to compute the sum of all the digits of n.
Given a positive integer n, write a program to find whether n is a prime number or not.
Given a positive integer n, write a program to reverse the digits of n and print the final result from a single variable.


Assignment Questions: The assignment questions are evaluated before the end of the lab session.
Write a program to print the first 10 rows of the multiplication table of a given number, in the following format.
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
The Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers. Write a program to find whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.
Write a program to read n numbers and print their sum. Use a loop to read n numbers.
Write a program to find the sum of the series 1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + ... n terms.
Given two positive integers n and k, write a program to reverse the last k digits  of n and print the final result consisting of k digits, where k is at most the number of digits in n.
Write a c program to find out the sum of an A.P. series.
Test Data :
Input the starting number of the A.P. series: 1
Input the number of items for the A.P. series: 10
Input the common difference of A.P. series: 4
Expected Output :
The Sum of the A.P. series are :
1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25 + 29 + 33 + 37 = 190

Extra Questions: These questions are not evaluated. You can solve these questions to improve your computational thinking process further.
Rewrite all the programs given in lab-2 using C language rather than simple-C.
Write a program to convert the given decimal number to its equivalent binary form.
Given a positive integer n, write a program to compute the series (1) + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) + ... + (1+2+3+4+...+n).
Given a positive integer n, write a program to check whether n can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
Write a program to print all prime numbers from 1 to n.
